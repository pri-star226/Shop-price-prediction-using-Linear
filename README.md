📈 Linear Regression Project
This repository contains a project on Linear Regression, a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

📌 Project Overview
Linear Regression is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. This project demonstrates how to:

Understand and visualize relationships in data

Build a linear regression model

Evaluate its performance using standard metrics

Interpret the results for actionable insights

📂 Dataset
Source: (Mention the dataset source — Kaggle, CSV file, etc.)

Fields:

name – Person’s name

age – Age of the person

product – Product purchased

product_price – Price of the product

id – Transaction or individual ID

Note: This data is primarily used for illustrative purposes.

🔍 Objective
To predict the product_price based on available features such as age, using Linear Regression.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Statsmodels (optional)

📊 Project Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Convert categorical variables if needed

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation matrix

Visualizations (scatter plots, histograms)

Model Building

Train-Test split

Fit a Linear Regression model using sklearn

Evaluation

R² Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Residual Analysis

Prediction

Predicting product prices based on age (or other variables)

📈 Example Results

Edit
R2 Score: 0.76  
MSE: 4200000  
The model shows a moderate relationship between age and product price. Further feature engineering can improve accuracy.
